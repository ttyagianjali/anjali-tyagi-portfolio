                    <p>It's been more than a year I am learning coding by myself. I started learning coding during lockdown. 
                        When I lost my job, I realized that the career I was pesuing is not enough to provide me financial stability and
                        job security also there are not so many opertunities in that field. The other thing is anybody can learn coding irrespective 
                        of their educational background.

                    <h5>Schooling and higher education</h5>
                    <p>After Completing my schooling in 2014, I did Bachelor's focused on Mechanical Engineering from P.T.U. 
                       I really liked Computer Aided Designing and 
                       Quality Management. So I took Project Management course in Sault College, Canada. 
                       I did my research before taking Project Management course and there was an overlap between the course I did in India and the course I was about 
                       to take in Canada. This is the reason why I took this course. But I was not aware that my bachelor's is not valid in Canada.
